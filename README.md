# BSNotes (Beat Saber Notes)
Is a Beat Saber mod for viewing text notes inside the game. 
## Usage
### General
In the games main menu, you will find the BSNotes button. With the exception of the settings, the mod is entirely contained within that menu. 

### Local Files
BSNotes will load .txt files which are saved within ``Beat Saber\UserData\BSNotes``. The folder ``Beat Saber\UserData\BSNotes\Archive`` is not visible in-game and is where your files will be moved to if you select the archive option on a note in game .

### W Panel
The W Panel shows the current version of the mod and a nice image of the character W from Arknights. This was included because W is best girl. If you are a heathen, the panel can be disabled in the settings.
